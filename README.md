# Teapot-Model
Teapot Model in JAVA

 In this program we are trying to draw a teapot with the bezier algorithm using the control points given.
The overal description is that we read each 4*4 control points given, draw a patch of them, and for showing the points 
we need to do 3d transformation by translating the object to the center, then rotating around z and x.
